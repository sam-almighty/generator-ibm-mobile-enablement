## Pre-requisites

Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

## Installation

``bash
npm install -g generator-ibm-mobile-enablement
``

## Usage

Following command line arguments are supported
* `--bluemix {stringified-json}` -  used by Scaffolder to supply project information from `pman`. You can also supply a local file containing compatible JSON object by using `--bluemix file:path/to/file.json` or pass the JSON in the CLI like `--bluemix "{\"backendPlatform\":\"NODE\"}"`. You will need at least a backendPlatform to run it locally.
* `--storages {stringified-array}` - used to add storage deployment to helm charts
* `--isDeployableContainer` -  if true add `container` to `deploy-target` in `cli-config.yaml`

## Development Environment

## Publishing Changes

In order to publish changes, you will need to fork the repository or ask to join the `ibm-developer` org and branch off the `master` branch.

Make sure to follow the [conventional commit specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) before contributing. To help you with commit a commit template is provide.
Run `config.sh` to initialize the commit template to your `.git/config`.

Once you are finished with your changes, run `npm test` to make sure all tests pass.

Do a pull request against `master`, make sure the build passes. A team member will review and merge your pull request.
Once merged to `master` one pull request will be created against `master`. Make sure that the CHANGELOG.md and the package.json is correct before merging the auto generated pull request. After the autogenerated 
pull request has been merged to `master` the version will be bumped and published to the NPM registry.
